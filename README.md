# SuperFriedo
## Super Friedolin!

Simple Mario clone done with SDL2 and SDL_Image2

## make
##### linux/macOS <br/>

```make unix```

##### win <br/>
```mingw32-make win```

##### What I learned:
* Getting into external libraries, especially SDL
* Pointer madness (Function pointers with structs since I wanted to have them where they belonged to)
* Managing a medium size project
